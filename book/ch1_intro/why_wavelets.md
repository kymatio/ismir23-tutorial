# Why use wavelets in music information retrieval?
==================================================

The modern theory of wavelets dates back to the 1980s, with wide industrial applications as soon as the 1990s.
In comparison, the renewed interest for deep learning is more recent: around the year 2012 in speech and image processing and at ISMIR a few years later.
Today, some of the most foundational elements of the standard MIR toolkit may involve wavelets, with CQT and chroma features being noteworthy examples.
However, these tools are no longer considered as original contributions.
Instead, current publications tend to take them for granted and apply them as preprocessing blocks to a deep neural network architecture.

As members of the Kymatio consortium, we recognize the value of end-to-end learning in its applications to music signal processing.
Long-standing MIR tasks such as automatic chord estimation and downbeat tracking have undoubtedly made great progress since the replacement of feature engineering by feature learning.
At the same time, the past decade has shown that wavelets are still relevant in scientific research; not so much in their own right but by producing fruitful interactions with machine learning models.
In this section, we outline five such modes of interaction:
1. Learning with limited labeled data
2. Physical interpretability
3. Biological plausbility
4. Artistic creation
5. Mathematical understanding

## 3. For biological plausibility

## 5. For the love of mathematics
