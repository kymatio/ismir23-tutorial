# Tutorial Structure

## Running the notebooks
---------------

The practical parts of this tutorial are delivered via Google Colab notebooks, found in:

- {doc}`../ch2_wavelets/1_wavelets`
- {doc}`../ch3_scattering/2_scattering`
- {doc}`../ch4_mir/3_ipt_classification`
- {doc}`../ch5_gear/4_gear`
- {doc}`../ch6_dtfa/5_dtfa`

{doc}`../ch4_mir/3_ipt_classification` makes use of a dataset of musical instrument playing techniques with precomputed features. 
To access this dataset, please see this tutorial's dedicated channel on the ISMIR23 Slack workspace, or contact the {doc}`../ch7_resources/authors`.

## Installation
---------------
We rely on the accessible GPU acceleration that's provided in the Colab environment. All installation is handled within the Colab notebooks.
We make use of a supplementary package `s1dt` for utility functions, feature extraction, and visualizations: [ismir23-kymatio-tools](https://github.com/cyrusvahidi/ismir23-kymatio-tools).
The main dependencies in each Colab notebook are `kymatio-0.4-dev` and `s1dt`, which can be installed from source:

```bash
!pip install git+https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio.git #Â install kymatio v0.4-dev from source
!pip install git+https://github.com/cyrusvahidi/ismir23-kymatio-tools.git # install helper library for this tutorial
```

## Community
---------------
Get in touch via the [Kymatio](https://kymat.io) community on [Github](https://github.com/kymatio/kymatio) or [X](https://twitter.com/KymatioWavelets/).

```{note}
The contents of this book will be continually updated after the ISMIR tutorial on November 5th 2023.
Time-frequency scattering is currently only available in `beta` via the `kymatio.torch` frontend.
It can be installed from source and will be officially released in Kymatio `v0.4`. 
Stay up-to-date on [X](https://twitter.com/KymatioWavelets/).
