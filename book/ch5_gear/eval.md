# Generative Evaluation of Audio Representations
------------------------------------------------
We compute the manifold embedding of the generated dataset's nearest neighbor graph under a number acoustic representations of the dataset:

1. Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients
2. Time Scattering
3. Time-Frequency Scattering
4. Open-L3 deep feature embeddings (music encoder)

We first transform the audio dataset $x$ under each acoustic feature representation $S$, then run the Isomap algorithm over the AM/FM 4096 signals in $Sx$.

To visualize similarity relationships between the AM/FM signals, we apply the Isomap algorithm for unsupervised dimensionality reduction \cite{tenenbaum2000global}.

Isomap assembles a geodesic distance matrix by using neighborhood relationships from high-dimensional Euclidean distances. We first compute the MFCCs, Scattering1D and JTFS coefficients, and OpenL3 embeddings over the dataset of AM/FM signals generated by $g$

To compute the nearest neighbor graph, we consider the 40 nearest neighbors for each transformed data point.

We select three components for the manifold visualization. The audio dataset described in Section \ref{sec:dataset} characterizes three independent degrees of freedom, therefore we postulate that Isomap will reveal whether the coordinates of an audio representation reflect similarities within the AM/FM signals.

Fig. \ref{fig:isomaps}(b) and (c) show three-dimensional (3-D) visualizations of the Isomap embeddings for time scattering ($Q=1$) and time--frequency scattering ($Q=8$), respectively. 

In the case of both transformations and the application of Isomap manifold learning, the dataset of AM/FM signals is represented as a 3-D mesh where the principal components align independently with $f_c$, $f_m$ and $\gamma$. Both transformations with their respective hyperparameters are capable of disentangling and linearizing fundamental frequency, tremolo rate and chirp rate, which describe spectrotemporal modulation patterns. 

Fig. \ref{fig:isomaps}(c) visualizes the embedding for time scattering when $Q = 8$. 

In this case, we observe that time scattering lies on a 2-D manifold that adequately describes $f_c$ and $\gamma$, yet fails to account for similarity in $f_m$ due to the aforementioned reasons. 

Despite time scattering successfully disentangling the 3 factors of variability when $Q = 1$, other applications may demand a a greater quality factor in order to better localize in frequency.
