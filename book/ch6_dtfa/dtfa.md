DTFA: Differentiable Time-Frequency Analysis
============================================

The advent of differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) in music information retrieval has greatly advanced our ability to train neural networks on real-world audio with little or no supervision.
Since 2020, DDSP models have found fruitful applications in sound matching, digital audio effects, and computational analysis of musical performance.
We refer to [1] for a recent review of the state of the art in this domain.
