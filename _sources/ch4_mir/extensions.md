There are various avenues for future experimentation with hybrid scattering convnets. 
In this tutorial, we only explored 1D convnets along time. 
Time-frequency scattering in Kymatio offers the `"joint"` output format, which is indexed by `(path, frequency, time)`. 
Therefore we can do 2D convolutions in the time-frequency domain, where the joint time-frequency scattering paths
serve as input channels to the convnet.
This was shown to be effective for classification of musical instrument solos with limited annotated data [1].
We did not explore the effectiveness of log-compression and mean normalization of scattering paths as was shown in [1] and [2].
We could explore joint classification of musical instrument and playing technique.
Various recent works have modelled human perception of similarity between sounds at the level of expressive playing techniques [2], [3].
